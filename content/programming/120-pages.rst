The mayavi manual in SVN has now 120 pages when compiled to pdf. I know
that this is a stupid metric, and that the quality is more important
then the number of pages, but it does give me a warm and fuzzy feeling.

More seriously, next release of Mayavi (coming soon, we promise) is
going to have a lot of added documentation for the casual users. In
particular the `mlab section`_ has been expended a lot and is starting
to hint at Mayavi's full power.

Thanks to Chris Casey, who is making sure that the docs land on the net
as soon as they are written.
