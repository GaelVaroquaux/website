There will be two tutorial tracks at the conference, an introductory one,
to bring up to speed with the Python language as a scientific tool, and
an advanced track, during which experts of the field will lecture on
specific advanced topics such as advanced use of numpy, scientific
visualization, software engineering...

Main conference topics

We will be soliciting talks on the follow topics:

#. Presentations of scientific tools and libraries using the Python
   language, including but not limited to:

   -  Vector and array manipulation
   -  Parallel computing
   -  Scientific visualization
   -  Scientific data flow and persistence
   -  Algorithms implemented or exposed in Python
   -  Web applications and portals for science and engineering

#. Reports on the use of Python in scientific achievements or ongoing
   projects.
#. General-purpose Python tools that can be of special interest to the
   scientific community.
