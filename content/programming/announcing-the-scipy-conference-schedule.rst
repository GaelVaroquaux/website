The SciPy conference committee is pleased to announce the schedule of
the conference:

http://conference.scipy.org/schedule

This year's program is very rich. In order to limit the number of
interesting talks that we had to turn down, we decided to reduce the
length of talks. Although this results in many short talks, we hope that
it will foster discussions, and give new ideas. Many subjects are
covered, both varying technical subject in the scientific computing
spectrum, and covering a lot of different research areas.

I would personally like to thank the members of the program committee,
who spent time reviewing the proposed abstracts and giving the chairs
feedback.

Fernando Perez and the tutorial presenters are hard at work finishing
planning all the details of the two-day tutorial session that will
precede the conference. An introduction tutorial track and an advanced
tutorial track, both covering various aspect of scientific computing in
Python, presented by experts in the field, should help many people
getting up to speed on the amazing technology driving this community.
