I just arrived in Austin, Texas. I need to settle down a bit more, blog
about my fantastic holidays, but I wanted to give an update of where I
was.

The hospitality here has been fantastic so far. I am sitting in a confy
chair, sipping a fresh orange juice, after having spend a night in a
very cosy bungalow and waking up to see two fawns in the garden. I would
say that the Enthought guys really know how to treat there hosts. It
seems to be something the Python scientific community is really good at,
judging from my different experiences (Fernando, and JB Poline).
