Packt publishing sent me a copy of `NumPy 1.5 Beginner's guide`_ by Ivan
Idris.

The book actually covers more than only `numpy`_: it is a full
introduction to numerical computing with Python. The `table of
contents`_ is the following:

-  NumPy Quick Start
-  Beginning with NumPy Fundamentals
-  Get into Terms with Commonly Used Functions
-  Convenience Functions for Your Convenience
-  Working with Matrices and ufuncs
-  Move Further with NumPy Modules
-  Peeking Into Special Routines
-  Assure Quality with Testing
-  Plotting with Matplotlib
-  When NumPy is Not Enough: SciPy and Beyond

The book is easy to read, as it requires no specific expertise other
than knowing basic Python programming. It is full of examples and
exercises, which is really great for learning. I find the style of the
author, Ivan Idris, particularly amusing and relaxing, engaging the
reader with questions, challenges, or even jokes (*"Have a go hero"*).

With regards to the formatting and the print, the book is written in
large fonts, with sectioning information, tips and exercises clearly
standing out.

It is full of practical information, such as how to install the
software, or where to get help. Finally, One thing that I appreciated,
is that the examples are typed in `IPython`_. Each time I teach, I like
to use IPython, because it is full of features to help plotting,
debugging and profiling numerical code. The book even has a little
introduction to some useful IPython features.

After an introduction to the work flow, the book explores array
manipulation such as creation or reshaping, followed by some simple
numerics and the battery of array-based operations on functions and
polynomials. Then it presents linear algebra and signal processing
basics (FFT). It also covers the financial functions that are present in
numpy and mentions testing, which is very important to achieve quality
code. The book finishes with matplotlib and scipy, two modules that are
important to know to go further.

The examples are mostly drawn from statistics or financial applications,
such as computing running averages on stock quotes. Basic math
explanations, such as the definition of the Moore-Penrose
pseudo-inverse, are given when needed.

To conclude, I enjoyed this book and I think that it is a nice addition
to my library. It answers exactly it's title: it is well-suited for
beginners wanting to learn numpy. On the other hand, I would not
recommend it as a reference material, or as a book to learn more general
scientific or numerical computing with Python.
