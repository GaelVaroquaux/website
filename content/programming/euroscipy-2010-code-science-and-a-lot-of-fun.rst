`Euroscipy 2010`_, the third European conference for the use of Python in
science, is just over, and I think it was a great success.

Euroscipy in numbers
====================

The attendance this year was huge: there was a grand total of 160 who
came to EuroScipy, with 140 that came only to the tutorials, and 130 only
the conference. This up by almost a factor of 3 compared to last year's
EuroScipy, more than last year's SciPy conference in Passadena, and
almost as much as this year's SciPy conference in Austin that hosted 180
person. We had people coming from 16 country, and as far as New Zealand,
the US, or Turkey. Research lab, education, and industry (small to large
companies) were all well represented, with approximately a third of the
delegates coming from the industry. Similarly, many different scientific
field were discussed, ranging from landscape ecology to pure math.

There were 2 tutorial tracks with 10 tutorial slots in each track. We
had 2 keynotes from Hans Petter Langtangen and Konrad Hinsen. With
regards to the contributed talks, the conference this year was highly
selective. We received 52 propositions. We unfortunately could accept
only 30 of them, which corresponds to an acceptance rate of 58%.
Finally, we had 18 `lightning talks`_.

A warm and friendly atmosphere
==============================

As an organizer, I was really pleased to find out how much people were
relaxed and friendly. This certainly facilitates discussions during the
breaks. And the ambiance was undoubtedly warm: 140 people with laptops
in a room without air conditioning in the Paris summer :).

Of course during the evenings, many people met to continue the
passionate discussions in restaurants and bars.

Trends I noticed
================

What one remembers from a conference is obviously biased by personal
interests. With that disclaimer, here are the recurrent and important
topics that I noticed, both in the talks, but also in the coffee break
discussions:

-  **Parallel computing**, in particular making it easy to do parallel
   computing. `Konrad's keynote`_ had many interesting directions to
   explore. (talks: `Playdoh`_, `DANA`_).

-  **Code generation**. In the various conferences I have been to
   recently, I heard much talking about symbolic manipulation of
   numerical problems to generate optimal computing kernels (talks:
   `Efficient computation tutorial`_, `Theano`_, `Algorithmic
   Differentiation`_.

-  **Data management**, with problems such as provenance tracking for
   reproducibility (talks: `Sumatra`_, `Knowledge management
   tutorial`_).

Finally installation problems of scientific tools were the subject of
many discussions, as each year. One thing that I did notice, is that
people stopped simply blaming each others and acknowledged that nobody
knew how to fix the problem. Somebody even pointed out that installing
any major scientific code was not a piece of cake. Hans Petter and
others said that they had solved the problem by relying on a virtual
machine and Ubuntu.

Konrad has also `blogged`_, giving his own view of the conference.

Thanks
======

The conference could happen only because of the help of many people.
First we need to thank our sponsors: `Enthought`_, `Python Academy`_,
`Pytables`_, and especially our host `Ecole Normale Supérieure`_, which
not only provided us with the rooms, but also made sure that everything
was going well with the sound system, the projection, or the access to
the building. With regards to organization and planing, Nicolas and I
received a lot of help from `Emmanuelle Gouillart`_.
