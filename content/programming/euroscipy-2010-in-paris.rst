Next year's EuroScipy will be in Paris, as Nicolas Chauvat and myself
announced in Leipzig this summer. We are still busy organizing, but we
have pretty much settled down for a dates: **July 8th- July 11th**. So
mark those dates, and get ready to come to Paris for a fantastic event
where Science meets computing thanks to Python.

On the Thursday and Friday, we will have 2 days of optional tutorials;
introductory ones to get up to speed with Python, and advanced ones,
where experts explain the tools they know best. On the Saturday and
Sunday, the main conference will be held, and if it is anywhere like
last year's, we will be hearing thrilling discussions with topics
ranging from the latest libraries for better scientific computing to how
Python was used in top-notch scientific achievements.
