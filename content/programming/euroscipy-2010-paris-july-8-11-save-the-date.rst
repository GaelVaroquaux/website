**EuroScipy 2010**, the 3rd European meeting on Python in Science, will
be held July 8-11 in the center of Paris, at the `Ecole Normale
Supérieure`_.

We have made good progress in the organization, and we already have `an
exciting program`_ although paper submission is not yet even open.

Tutorial tracks
===============

There will be two tutorials tracks:

-  `An introductory track`_, to bring attendees up to speed with Python
   in science. Even if you are a complete beginner, after these two
   days, you should be able to be efficient using Python for scientific
   purposes.
-  `An advanced tutorial track`_, covering in-depth specific tools and
   projects, aimed at experienced users and presented by leading experts
   of the topic.

We will soon be requesting feedback from you to help us choose between
the different thrilling tutorial propositions that we have for these
tracks. More on that later...

Keynote speakers
================

Hans Petter Langtangen
----------------------

-  `Simula laboratory`_, Oslo, director of scientific computing and
   bio-medical research
-  Author of the famous book `Python scripting for computational
   science`_

Konrad Hinsen

The exciting city of Paris
==========================

The conference will take place in the center of Paris, in the very
lively "quartier latin", in the prestigious and historical 'Ecole
Normale Supérieure'. In the morning, on your way to ENS, drop by a café
for a French croissant, served by a French waiter with a typical French
accent in English. In the evenings, walk one block to enjoy the night
life "rue Mouffetard", or venture further to stroll on the river banks
of the Seine, along which people dance to street music.
