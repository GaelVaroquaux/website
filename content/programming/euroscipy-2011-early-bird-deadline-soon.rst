Euroscipy 2011: register now for early bird prices
==================================================

**The deadline for early-bird registration at the Euroscipy conference
is this Sunday**. Beyond this deadline prices will double. **Register
now to get a great deal.**

To register, simply go to `www.euroscipy.org`_, log in using the link on
the top right, and follow the *'Register now for the conference'* link
on the top left.

The conference is a great opportunity to learn the intricacies of
numerical and scientific computing in Python. You can register for the
tutorials in a `intro track`_, that will take you from beginner to fully
autonomous user, or for an `advanced track`_, to learn from the experts
topics such as image processing, GPU computing, machine learning or
optimization. The tutorials are a fairly unique occasion to improve your
skills, as you will seldom get such a concentration of experts.

Some program highlights
=======================

After the 2 days of tutorial, the conference itself we host 2 keynotes:
one by `Marian Petre`_, of the open university, well-known for her
empirical studies of software development, and another one by `Fernando
Perez`_, a pioneer in scientific computing in Python and the original
author of IPython.

Glancing at the `program`_, we can see how a wide range of topics are
touched:

-  pure computer-science topics, such as `concurrent programming`_
-  traditional *hard* sciences, such as `multi-physics`_
-  simulation of complex systems, for instance `network modeling in
   epidemiology`_
-  or novel application of quantitative large-data processing, as in
   `legal research`_

The variety of the topics illustrates what is for me one of the greatest
benefits of the scipy conferences: they form a forum to exchange ideas
and techniques to find new solutions to scientific, numerical and data
analysis problems. Unlike the pure computer science conference, they sit
at the frontier of applications and bleeding edge computer developments,
**because these people really use the tools presented to solve their
problems**.

In addition to this rich program, we will have 2 days of `sprints`_
before the conference as well as 2-day-long satellite conferences on
Python in `Physics`_ and `NeuroScience`_ after the conference. This is
how what used to be a small conference can now be a full 8-days event if
you order all the extras.
