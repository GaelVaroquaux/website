Given that we have been able to turn on registration only very late, the
`EuroScipy`_ conference committee is extending the deadline for abstract
submission for the 2010 EuroScipy conference.

On Thursday May 20th, at midnight Samoa time, we will turn off the
abstract submission on the conference site. Up to then, you can modify
the already-submitted abstract, or submit new abstracts.

We are very much looking forward to your submissions to the conference.
