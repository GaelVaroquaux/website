The registration for `EuroScipy`_ is finally open.
==================================================

To register, go to the `website`_, create an account, and you will see a
*'register to the conference'* button on the left. Follow it to a page
which presents a *'shoping cart'*. Simply submitting this information
registers you to the conference, and on the left of the website, the
button will now display *'You are registered for the conference'*.

The registration fee is 50 euros for the conference, and 50 euros for
the tutorial. Right now there is no payment system: you will be
contacted later (in a week) with instructions for paying.

We apologize for such a late set up. We do realize this has come as an
inconvenience to people.

**Do not wait to register: the number of people we can host is
limited.**

An exciting program
===================

Tutorials: from beginners to experts
------------------------------------

We have two tutorial tracks:

-  `**Introductory tutorial**`_: to get you to speed on scientific
   programming with Python.
-  `**Advanced tutorial**`_: experts sharing their knowledge on specific
   techniques and libraries.

Scientific track: doing new science in Python
---------------------------------------------

Although the abstract submission is not yet over, I can say that we are
going to have a rich set of talks, looking at the current submissions.
In addition to the contributed talks, we have:

-  `**Keynote speakers**`_: Hans Petter Langtangen and Konrard Hinsen,
   two major player of scientific computing in Python.
-  `**Lightning talks**`_: one hour will be open for people to come up
   and present in a flash an interesting project.

Publishing papers
-----------------

We are talking with the editors of a major scientific computing journal,
and the odds are quite high that we will be able to publish a special
issue on scientific computing in Python based on the proceedings of the
conference. The papers will undergo peer-review independently from the
conference, to ensure high quality of the final publication.

Call for papers
===============

Abstract submission is still open, though not for long. We are
soliciting contributions on scientific libraries and tools developed
with Python and on scientific or engineering achievements using Python.
These include applications, teaching, future development directions, and
current research. See the `call for papers`_.

\ **I am very much looking forward to passionate discussions about
Python in science in Paris**\
