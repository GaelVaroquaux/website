Submission deadline May 8th
===========================

The deadline for the call for presentation for the EuroScipy conference
is on **May 8th**. There is only a week and a half left.

`EuroScipy`_ will be held in **Paris, August 25-28**. It is the European
meeting for users of Python in scientific and numerical-intensive
applications. It strives to bring together both users and developers of
scientific and numerical tools, as well as academic research and state
of the art industry. The conference will host 2 days of tutorials and 2
days of technical presentations.

Lately, numerical computing in Python has started reaching a much wider
audience than the traditional academic-oriented audience. This is partly
because Python is making its way in major engineering companies, but
also because more and more industries are processing large amounts of
data, and find precious **data analytics tools** in the `Scipy`_
community. In this spirit, this year there will be a `tutorial on
machine learning with Python`_.

Poster session
==============

Last year, the organizing committee had to refuse a large fraction of
the proposals, because there were not enough slots available. We had
considered organizing a poster sessions, but the logistics were to
challenging for our little resources. Indeed, EuroSciPy still tries to
be organized as a hackers and coders conference, rather than an
industry-level one. For instance, we keep the prices to a minimum, in
order to make it easy for young people traveling on their own budget to
join us. Getting 200 attendees as we did last year, did strain our small
organization committee.

This year, we had a unexpected backing of the `physics department`_ of
the `ENS`_. They were extremely enthusiastic about Python, that they now
use for teaching and research. This made me really happy, as this is
where I studied. They proposed help, and in particular help with the
local organization.

Thus I am able to announce that thanks to the physics department of the
ENS, we will be able to host a poster session!

An exciting program shaping up
==============================

The program is starting to shape up, and it is looking really good, in
my eyes.

Keynotes
--------

We will be having two keynote speakers, one directly from the SciPy
community, Fernando Perez, and one probably less known to this
community, Marian Petre.

-  `Marian Petre`_: Marian is the director of the `Center for Research
   in Computing`_, at the `Open University`_. She is interested in
   empirical studies of software development. I am very excited to hear
   a bit more about the often-forgotten human factor that goes behind
   every coding job, big or small. In my experience scientific computing
   and computational sciences pay a hefty price because they don't
   acknowledge well-enough the gap between good ideas and tractable
   code.
-  `Fernando Perez`_: Fernando is a research scientist in
   neuroscience at `UC Berkeley`_. Before that, he was successively a
   physicist and a mathematician. He has been an early advocate of the
   scientific Python ecosystem, in addition to being the creator of
   IPython. His vision has always been oriented toward finding an
   computing environment that makes scientific creativity easier.

Tutorials
---------

The tutorial program is now final, and can be seen on the `schedule`_.
Like last year, we will have two tracks:

-  `An introductory track`_, designed as a two-day course addressing
   the different aspects of the Python language and the scientific
   computing module to bring up beginners to full speed. At the end of
   the two days, attendee should be able to solve simple computational
   problems using Python alone.
-  `An advanced track`_, in which experts of various aspects of
   scientific and numerical computing in Python share their knowledge in
   2-hours long tutorials.

Python in NeuroScience satellite
================================

The two days following the conference, their will be `a satellite
meeting on the use Python in neuroscience`_. It will be a small and more
focused event, in which neuroscientist will be able to exchange
technical aspects of computation and data management in Python.
Hopefully it will foster interest discussions and collaborations. if you
are interested, you can submit a talk proposal for this satellite
meeting `here`_.

**Come and join us at EuroScipy in Paris, Augst 25-28. Paris is a great
city. The SciPy community is a friendly one.**
