Extracting the data from the Delaunay triangulation

Gary Ruben just asked me if it was possible to retrieve the
triangulation information from my previous Delaunay example. Actually
the reason I came up with this example is that Emanuelle Gouillart, my
partner[\*], needed to do Delaunay triangulation on some data. She was
kind enough to extract that code from her code base. `Here`_ it is.

[\*] The various languages do not seem to have evolved quickly enough to
cope with the fact that people can now have a stable long-term
relationship with someone you are not married to. What word should I be
using here: 'girlfriend', 'partner'... ?
