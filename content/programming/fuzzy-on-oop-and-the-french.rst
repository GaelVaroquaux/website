.. epigraph::

    Haha - I shake my fuzzywuzzy beard at you in bewilderment. Do you people
    dislike OOP, the class statement is mere boilerplate to you, I mumble
    incoherent French obscenities in your general direction. (Did you know
    the French acronym for object-oriented programming is POO?).
