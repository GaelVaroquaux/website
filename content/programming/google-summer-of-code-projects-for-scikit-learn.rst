I’d like to welcome the four students that were accepted for the GSoC
this year:

* Issam: `Extending Neural networks <http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/issamou/5733935958982656>`_
* Hamzeh: `Sparse Support for Ensemble Methods <http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/hamsal/5709068098338816>`_
* Manoj: `Making Linear models faster <http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/manojkumar/5673522948997120>`_
* Maheshakya: `Locality Sensitive Hashing <http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/maheshakya/5754903989321728>`_

Welcome to all of you. Your submissions were excellent, and you
demonstrated a good will to integrate in the project, with its social and
coding dynamics. It is a privilege to work with you.

I’d also like to thank all the mentors, Alex, Arnaud, Daniel, James,
Jaidev, Olivier, Robert and Vlad. It is a lot of work to mentor and
mentors are not only making it possible for great code to enter
scikit-learn, but also shaping a future generation of scikit-learn
contributors.
