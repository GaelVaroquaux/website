The `scikit-learn`_ is a Python module for machine learning. The
project builds on the scientific and numerical tools of the `scipy
community`_ to provide state-of-the-art data analysis tools. It is
developed by a community of open source developers to which my research
team (`Parietal`_, `INRIA`_) contributes a lot and is a `striving
project`_. Its mailing list fosters many discussions on code and machine
learning topics, it has a `a very detailed documentation`_, and `a tight
release cycle`_.

Although scikits.learn is mostly developed by volunteers, INRIA has
funded a two year position for a junior engineer —currently `Fabian
Pedregosa`_— to help with the core management and integration of the
project. This funding is coming to an end in falls 2011 `[\*]`_. The
good news is that we have been allocate new funding to hire an engineer
on the scikit.

**We are thus looking to hire a junior engineer for a 2-year position to
work on the scikits.learn at INRIA in Saclay, near Paris**. The position
is only available to candidates that have received a **masters or
equivalent degree at most a year ago** — this is non negotiable: we
cannot hire more senior candidates.

We are looking for a developer with good open-source project management
skills: the successful candidate will review and merge patches, ensure
the quality of the scikit, make releases, coordinate development on the
mailing list and on github. Good knowledge of Python and its scientific
ecosystem is expected. A mathematical or computer-science oriented
mindset is a plus, as the project involves working with machine learning
algorithms.

The candidate should be willing to relocate to work daily in the
`Neurospin brain research institute`_ in which the Parietal is located.
Knowledge of French is not required, as the team and the institute are
very international. Non-EU candidates are welcome, but the hiring
process will take longer.

You will be working in a very stimulating environment. You will be
employed by INRIA, the French computer science research institute. As
such, you will benefit from the expertise of the institute's researchers
and engineers. Team members contribute to various scientific Python
libraries (in addition to scikits.learn, `Mayavi`_, `nipy`_, `joblib`_).
In addition, you will be working in a brain research institute, in
collaboration with leading `methods researchers`_ and `neuroscientists`_
that use machine learning to gain new insights on brain processes.

**To apply:** To apply, you need to prepare a CV and a motivation
letter. The deadline for applications is mid June, but we will be
selecting candidates and conducting interviews before. **Don't send me
CVs**. The formal job description, as well as instructions to apply can
be found on this `page`_. The page is mostly in French, sorry; use
Google translate if you don't understand. At the bottom of the page you
will find a link to apply.

\ **[\*]**\  Fabian will most probably stay with us to do a PhD on
`analysis of large brain functional imaging datasets`_.
