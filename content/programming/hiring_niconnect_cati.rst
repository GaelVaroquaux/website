**Work with us to leverage leading-edge machine learning for
neuroimaging**

At `Parietal <https://team.inria.fr/parietal>`_, my research team,
we work on improving the way brain images are analyzed, for medical
diagnostic purposes, or to understand the brain better. We develop
new machine-learning tools and investigate new methodologies for
for quantifying brain function from MRI scans.

One of our important alley of contributions is in deciphering "functional
connectivity": analysis the correlation of brain activity to measure
interactions across the brain. This direction of research is exciting
because it can be used to probe the neural-support of *functional*
deficits in incapacitated patients, and thus lead to new biomarkers on
functional pathologies, such as autism. Indeed, functional connectivity
can be computed without resorting to complicated cognitive tasks, unlike
most functional imaging approaches. The flip side is that exploiting such
"resting-state" signal requires advanced multivariate statistics tools,
something at which the Parietal team excels.

For such multivariate processing of brain imaging data, Parietal has an
ecosystem of `leading-edge high-quality tools
<https://team.inria.fr/parietal/software>`_. In particular we have built
the foundations of the most successful Python machine learning library,
`scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn>`_, and we are growing a dedicate
software, `nilearn <http://nilearn.github.io/>`_, that leverages
machine-learning for neuroimaging. To support this ecosystem, we have
dedicated top-notch programmers, lead by the well-known
`Olivier Grisel <http://ogrisel.com/>`_.


We are looking for a data-processing engineer to join our team and work
on **applying our tools on very large neuroimaging databases to
learn specific biomarkers of pathologies**. For this, the work will be
shared with the `CATI <http://www.cati-neuroimaging.com/>`_, the Fench
platform for multicentric neuroimaging studies, located in the same
building as us. The general context of the job is the `NiConnect
<https://team.inria.fr/parietal/research/spatial_patterns/niconnect/>`_
project, a multi-organisational research project that I lead and
that focuses on improving diagnostic tools on resting-state functional
connectivity. We have access to unique algorithms and datasets, before
they are published. What we are now missing between those two, and that
link could be you.

If you want more details, they can be found on the `job offer
<https://team.inria.fr/parietal/job-offers>`_. This post is to motivate
the job in a personal way, that I cannot give in an official posting.

Why take this job?
===================

I don't expect some to take this job only because it pays the bill. To be
clear, the kind of person I am looking for has no difficulties finding a
job elsewhere. So, if you are that person, why would you take the job?

* To join `a great team <https://team.inria.fr/parietal/team-members/>`_
  with many experts, focused on finding elegant solutions to hard
  problems at the intersection of machine learning, cognitive science,
  and software. Choose to work with great people, knowledgeable,
  passionate, and `fun
  <https://team.inria.fr/parietal/inria-winter-party-2014/>`_.

* To work on interesting problems, that matter. They are interesting
  because they are challenging but we have the skills to solve them. They
  matter because they can make brain research better.

* To learn. NeuroImaging + Machine learning is a quickly growing topic.
  If you come from a NeuroImaging background and want to add to your CV
  an actual expertise in machine learning for NeuroImaging. This is the
  place to be.

What would make me excited in a resume?
========================================

* A genuine experience in neuroimaging data processing, especially large
  databases.

* Talent with computers and ideally some Python experience.

* The unlikely combination of research training (graduate or
  undergraduate) and experience in a non academic setting.

* A problem-solving mindset.

* A good ability to write about neuroimaging and data processing in
  English: who knows, if everything goes to plan, you could very well be
  publishing about new biomarkers.
