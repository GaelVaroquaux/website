I have been traveling recently and talking to friendly Geeks I didn't
know yet. I have been surprised to see that many people were pronouncing
"Mayavi", "Maya-V-I", is in "V-I", like the old Unix editor. Maybe this
comes from the spelling "MayaVi", that Prabhu and I recently decided to
avoid. Well, Mayavi is actually pronounced "Ma-ya-vee", and it comes
from an old sanskrit name meaning magician.
