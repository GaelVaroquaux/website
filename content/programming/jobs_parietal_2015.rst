=============================================================

We, `Parietal team <https://team.inria.fr/parietal/>`_ at `INRIA
<http://www.inria.fr/>`_, are recruiting software developers to work on
open source machine learning and neuroimaging software in Python.

In general, we are looking for people who:

 * have a mathematical mindset,
 * are curious about data (ie like looking at data and understanding it)
 * have an affinity for problem-solving tradeoffs
 * love high-quality code
 * worry about users
 * are good scientific Python coders,
 * enjoy interacting with a community of developers

We welcome candidates people without all the skills, but are strongly
motivated to acquire them. Prior open-source experience is a big plus.

One example of such position with application in Neuroimaging is:
http://gael-varoquaux.info/programming/hiring-a-programmer-for-a-brain-imaging-machine-learning-library.html
Which was opened a year ago and has now resulted in nilearn:
http://nilearn.github.io/

Other positions may be more focused on general machine learning or
computing tools such as scikit-learn and joblib, which are reference
open-source libraries for data processing in Python.

We are a tightly knit team, with a high degree of programming, data
analysis and neuroimaging skills.

Please contact me and Olivier Grisel if you are interested,
