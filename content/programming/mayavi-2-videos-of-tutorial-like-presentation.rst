I gave a presentation on Mayavi in the Python for science seminar
organised by Fernando Perez at Berkeley. I was loudmouth and obnoxious
as usual, and unfortunately for me, I was recorded.

More seriously, Jeff Teeters has filmed the presentation and recorded
the sound was a microphone I was wearing. I find that he did a really
excellent job. Getting a good recording is **hard**, and he really got
good audio and good framing. I am amazed and I don't know how to thank
him enough.

Also, Stefan van der Waalt gave a talk in Souft Africa on Mayavi that
was recorded. Another very useful resource for learning Mayavi:
