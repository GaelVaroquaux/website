Prabhu and I can't decide: what is best for the documentation, have more
pages, and thus have them be small, or have longer pages, but have less.
Two specific examples:

http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/docs/development/html/mayavi/examples.html

http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/docs/development/html/mayavi/mlab.html

Right now, these pages are split in smaller pages. Should all these
smaller pages be folded back in one long page? It would be a long page,
but all the information would be there.

Neither Prabhu, nor I, want to decide solely on our personnal
preference. We would to do what suits users most. This I why we want
FEEDBACK :). Could you please give feedback by mail, or in a comment on
this blog. Thank you!
