Thanks to the combined efforts of Ondrej Certik, who made me do the
necessary tarballs, and Varun Hiremath, who finalized the packaging
efforts, Mayavi2 is now in Debian (
http://packages.debian.org/sid/mayavi2 ). Currently, it is in testing,
but it will soon trickle down to unstable. Along with Mayavi2, we have
two new Debian packages: Traits, and TraitsUI, two other absolutely
great Python packages and, IMHO, fundamental technologies.

This is looking very good for simplifying reuse of these technologies.
