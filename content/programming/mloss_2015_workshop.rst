.. note::

    *This year again we will have an exciting workshop on the
    leading-edge machine-learning open-source software. This subject is
    central to many, because software is how we propagate, reuse, and
    apply progress in machine learning.*

    **Want to present a project? The deadline for the call for papers is
    Apr 28th, in a few days**
    : http://mloss.org/workshop/icml15/



The workshop will be help at the `ICML conference
<http://icml.cc/2015/>`_, in Lille France, on July 10th. ICML
--International Conference in Machine Learning-- is the leading venue for
academic research in machine learning. It's a fantastic place to hold
such a workshop, as the actors of theoretical progress are all around.
Software is the bridge that brings this progress beyond papers.

There is a `long tradition <http://mloss.org/workshop/>`_ of MLOSS
workshop, with one every year and a half. Last time, at NIPS 2013, I
could feel a bit of a turning point, as people started feeling that
different software slotted together, to create an efficient and
state-of-the art working environment. For this reason, we have entitled
this year's workshop 'open ecosystems', stressing that contributions in
the scope of the workshop, that build a thriving work environment, are
not only machine learning software, but also better statistics or
numerical tools.

We have two keynotes with important contributions to such ecosystems:

* `John Myles White <http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/>`_ (Facebook), lead
  developer of Julia statistics and machine learning: "Julia for machine
  learning: high-level syntax with compiled-code speed"

* `Matthew Rocklin <http://matthewrocklin.com>`_ (Continuum Analytics),
  developer of Python computational tools, in particular Blaze (confirmed):
  "Blaze, a modern numerical engine with out-of-core and out-of-order
  computations".

There will be also a practical presentation on how to set up an
open-source project, discussing hosting, community development, quality
assurance, license choice, by yours truly.
