We really need to get numpy 1.0.5 out. And for this release to rock, we
want to have good docs. This is why Jarrod offered to have a doc sprint
tomorrow.

In addition we are currently having a sprint in Paris for neuroimaging
in Python, with a bunch of numpy developers. Some of us are going to
work on the doc sprint tomorrow. We will have a room dedicated to this.

It would be great if people in Paris join us. If you want to have great
fun with Python geeks and get the chance to make numpy better, send an
e-mail to Jarrod ( <millman> at <berkeley>  dot <edu> ). The venue is in
Paris 6ème.

See you all tomorrow.
