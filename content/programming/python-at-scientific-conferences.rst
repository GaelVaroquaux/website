Top notch scientific conferences are starting to add Python tracks to
their program. This is good news. Indeed, it scientific Python
conferences (namely `Scipy`_, `EuroSciPy`_ and `Scipy India`_) are doing
great to get together people who have already heard about Python for
science, but we need to reach out to specific Python communities to
maximize impact.

ESCO 2012 - European Seminar on Coupled Problems
================================================

`ESCO 2012`_ is the 3rd event in a series of interdisciplineary meetings
dedicated to computational science challenges in multi-physics and PDEs.

I was invited as ESCO last year. It was an aboslute pleasure, because it
is a small conference that is very focused on discussions. I learned a
lot and could sit down with people who code top notch PDE libraries such
as FEniCS and have technical discussions. Besides, it is hosted in the
historical brewery where the Pilsner was invented. Plenty of great beer.

**Application areas** Theoretical results as well as applications are
welcome. Application areas include, but are not limited to:
Computational electromagnetics, Civil engineering, Nuclear engineering,
Mechanical engineering, Computational fluid dynamics, Computational
geophysics, Geomechanics and rock mechanics, Computational hydrology,
Subsurface modeling, Biomechanics, Computational chemistry, Climate and
weather modeling, Wave propagation, Acoustics, Stochastic differential
equations, and Uncertainty quantification.

**Minisymposia**

-  Multiphysics and Multiscale Problems in Civil Engineering
-  Modern Numerical Methods for ODE
-  Porous Media Hydrodynamics
-  Nuclear Fuel Recycling Simulations
-  Adaptive Methods for Eigenproblems
-  Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for Electromagnetics
-  Undergraduate Projects in Technical Computing

**Software afternoon** Important part of each ESCO conference is a
software afternoon featuring software projects by participants.
Presented can be any computational software that has reached certain
level of maturity, i.e., it is used outside of the author's institution,
and it has a web page and a user documentation. If you would like to
present your software project, let us know soon.

**Proceedings** For each ESCO we strive to reserve a special issue of an
international journal with impact factor. Proceedings of ESCO 2008
appeared in Math. Comput. Simul., proceedings of ESCO 2010 in CiCP and
Appl. Math. Comput. Proceedings of ESCO 2012 will appear in Computing.

**Important Dates**

-  December 15, 2011: Abstract submission deadline.
-  December 15, 2011: Minisymposia proposals.
-  January 15, 2012: Notification of acceptance.

PyHPC: Python for High performance computing
============================================

If you are doing super computing, `SC11, the Super Computing
conference`_ is *the* reference conference. This year there will a
workshop on high performance computing with Python: `PyHPC`_.

At the scipy conference, I was having a discussion with some of the
attendees on how people often still do process management and I/O with
Fortran in the big computing environment. This is counter productive.
However, has success stories of supercomputing folks using high-level
languages are not advertized, this is bound to stay. Come and tell us
how you use Python for high performance computing!

**Topics**

-  Python-based scientific applications and libraries
-  High performance computing
-  Parallel Python-based programming languages
-  Scientific visualization
-  Scientific computing education
-  Python performance and language issues
-  Problem solving environments with Python
-  Performance analysis tools for Python application

**Papers** We invite you to submit a paper of up to 10 pages via the
submission site. Authors are encouraged to use IEEE two column format.

**Important Dates**

* Full paper submission: September 19, 2011
* Notification of acceptance: October 7, 2011
* Camera-ready papers: October 31, 2011
