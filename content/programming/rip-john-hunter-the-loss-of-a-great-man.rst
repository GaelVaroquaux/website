John Hunter, the author of `matplotlib`_ passed away yesterday after a
short battle against cancer. John gave the keynote at the scipy 2012
conference a few weeks ago, and was diagnosed with cancer just on his
return from the conference. It is a shock to me that that a friend can
disappear so quickly. Please read the `announcement`_ of `Fernando
Perez`_, who supported John in the last weeks to learn more about John.

A man who gave a lot, not asking for anything in return
=======================================================

Many have benefited from the silent efforts of John, and are not fully
aware of how he generously invested his time and talent for the benefit
of others. Matplotlib, the Python plotting library that he created in
2002, has propelled Python as a major tool for scientific research and
engineering. The impact of John's efforts go well beyond Matplotlib.
Early on, John had the vision of Python as a interactive scientific
environment. He promoted this vision pairing with Fernando Perez to
develop the fantastic `ipython`_/`matplotlib`_ tandem, solving many
technical challenges. But he also invested a lot of energy in teaching
workshops that helped change the way people compute, as well as writing
didactic documentation and articles. He was a friendly, active, leader
of an online community, open and helpful to newcomers.

As Travis Oliphant said on John's numfocus `memorial webpage`_:

.. epigraph::

    Those who contribute much to open source, as John did, do so at the
    expense of something - often it is time with family.

I cannot stress how true this is. The entire open source software, that
nowadays supports our economy, our education, and our research, is built
on the shoulders of a fairly small number of generous people that spend
their energy in making better software, rather than personal wealth.

John was a humble man. He did not have a blog, or a twitter account, did
not seek fame or money. For this reason I feel that his contributions
are unknown and undervalued by many. In my eyes, he is an unknown
soldier of our modern times. I hope that I am not being too emphatic,
but this is how I feel.

.. note::

    **John passed away at 44, leaving behind a wife and 3 daughters. Please
    do consider supporting them:**
