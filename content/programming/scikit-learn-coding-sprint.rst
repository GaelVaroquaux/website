We have been really crap at communicating the next `scikit-learn`_
coding sprint. It's next week!

The coding sprint will take place the 8 and 9 September at `INRIA
Saclay`_, near Paris, in the room K110 (building K).

For those who cannot make it, it will be possible to participate using
the IRC chan (#scikit-learn on irc.freenode.net).

We will start at 9am (Paris time), and a sketch of the planning can be
found `here`_. In particular:

-  More docs! we still need tutorials: features selection, model
   selection, cross-validation, etc..
-  Make the `pipeline object`_ really work + illustration in different
   contexts.
-  Clean up and doc for bayesian approaches.
-  Implementation of PCA (fit + transform).
-  FastICA (adapt the `CanICA`_ code)
-  LDA : Covariance estimators (Ledoit-Wolf) and add transform.
-  `Preprocessing routines`_ (center, standardize) with fit transform.
-  Anything that you have a particular interest in.

Do not hesitate to send on the `mailing list`_ some advices on this
(incomplete...) list, and see you next week!

`scikit-learn`_ is a Python module for efficient and easy machine
learning using scipy and numpy.
