**The NIPS conference: time for a sprint.** The `NIPS conference`_, one
of the major conferences in machine learning, is hosted in Granada this
year. I believe that it is the first time that it is hosted in Europe.
As many of the `scikit-learn`_ developers are part of the wider NIPS
community, but also many live in Europe, we jumped on the occasion to
organize a truly international sprint: the `NIPS 2011 scikit-learn
sprint`_.

**Finding money.** As often with open source development, a lot of our
contributors are young people, investing their free time outside of any
request from their hierarchy. In such a situation, it can be hard to
find travel money. So we started looking for sponsors. We needed to find
a decent sum of money, as we were flying people in from places such as
the West coast of the US, or even Japan. The good news is that we found
money, and between supervisors pitching in, universities giving travel
grants, and our generous sponsors, there will be an impressive list of
contributors from all over the world at the sprint.

**Thanks to our sponsors.** The first people that we need to thank are
Google, who gave us a sizable sponsorship, and the `PSF`_, who made
Google's sponsorship possible through their accounting and sprints
programs. We also need to thanks our other sponsors, namely
`Tinyclues`_. Thanks to these sponsors, and additional investment from
many universities and research group, we have been able to gather a
total of 12 contributors in Granada, a handful coming from overseas.
Also, we are indebted to the `University of Granada`_, and the Gnu/Linux
Granada Group (GGG), who are providing hosting for the sprint, as well
as RÃ©gine Bricquet, from INRIA, who did a lot of the trip planing for
the sponsored people.

I am very much looking forward to the sprint. It will be the first time
that meet in real life many of the contributors, and judging by the
warmness of the on-line exchanges, it will be a great moment. Besides,
Granada is known to be a lively and historical city.
