We are finally opening the registration for the SciPy 2009 conference.
It took us time, but the reason  is that we made careful budget
estimations to bring the registration cost down.

We are very happy to announce that this year registration to the
conference will be only $150, tutorial $100, and students get half
price! We made this effort because we hope it will open up the
conference to more people, especially students that often have to
finance such trip with little budget. As a consequence, however,
catering at noon is not included.

This does not mean that we are getting a reduced conference. Quite on
the contrary, this year we have two keynote speakers. And what speakers:
Peter Norvig and Jon Guyer! Peter Norvig is the director of research at
Google and Jon Guyer is a research scientist at NIST, in the
Thermodynamics and Kinetics Group, where he leads a fiPy, a finite
element project in Python.

The SciPy 2009 Conference
=========================

SciPy 2009, the `8th Python in Science conference`_, will be held from
August 18-23, 2009 at Caltech in Pasadena, CA, USA.

Each year SciPy attracts leading figures in research and scientific
software development with Python from a wide range of scientific and
engineering disciplines. The focus of the conference is both on
scientific libraries and tools developed with Python and on scientific
or engineering achievements using Python.

Call for Papers
===============

We welcome contributions from the industry as well as the academic
world. Indeed, industrial research and development as well academic
research face the challenge of mastering IT tools for exploration,
modeling and analysis.

We look forward to hearing your recent breakthroughs using Python!
