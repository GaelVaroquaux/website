The SciPy conference proceedings are finally available online:
http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/SciPy2008 .

I hope you enjoy them. I find it great to have this set of excellent
articles talking about works done with, or for, Python in science. For
me, it is a reference to remember what was said at the conference. I
hope it can also be interesting for people who were not present at the
conference.

I apologize for being so slow at publishing them. In addition to the
round trip between authors and editors taking a while, I have been
travelling back home and spent way too much time last week finishing off
administrative duties in the US.
