We are organizing a coding sprint in Paris on `scikit learn`_,
**machine learning in Python**. The goal of this sprint is to set the
API and the general coding guidelines of the scikit to be able to tackle
many different statistical learning problems in a consistent framework.

This is why we would like to have people with different problems,
applications, and backgrounds to pitch in.

It will be a two-days sprint. Everyone is welcome, so just fill in the
`doodle`_, so that we can choose the date?

And do not hesitate to suggest some topics that you would like to be
addressed during the sprint, and to discuss them on the `mailing-list`_!

`Vincent Michel`_ is organizing the sprint. If you have questions about
the sprint, you are welcomed to contact me, but please do put him in Cc
to.
