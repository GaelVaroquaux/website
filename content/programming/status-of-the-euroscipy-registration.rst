It is still not possible to register for the `Euroscipy conference`_: we
are having difficulties with payment for the registration, and we are
still not sure that we will be able to actually charge money!

This might not be a bad news, because it might mean that the conference
will be completely free. This would mean that we would be able to
provide lunch which is a pity as there is nothing like eating with a
bunch of passionate experts to learn new tricks, but it would not hamper
the conference in any other way, as the rooms are already booked and
various little expenses covered.

If we manage to sort out payments in the next weeks, the fee should be
50 euros for the 2 days of tutorial, and between 50 and 100 euros for
the full conference, depending on exactly what catering we offer.

Anyhow, we should open the registration real-soon, with or without
payment. We will need to have some formal registration, as the number of
people that can fit in the rooms will be limited.

All in all, with or without registration fees, it should be possible to
make it to Euroscipy keeping expenses low: we have indicated a few cheap
accommodation on the `practical details page`_, and it is easy to get
good food for a good price in the area.

--------------

I am very excited about this conference. We have two keynotes that I am
really looking forward to hearing, and I can say that we have been
getting pretty good submissions for presentations. Also, changes are
that we should be able to publish proceedings in a peer-reviewed
journal, although I can't say more about that right now.


Also, even if you are not interested in scientific research done using
Python, the tutorials are a unique opportunity: we are having top-notch
experts presenting with two tracks, `one`_ to get beginners up to speed
and efficient in a couple of days, and the `other`_ for exploring
advanced subjects. I know the speakers, and I can tell you that I won't
be talking in the corridor, but sitting with my laptop and listening to
them. People pay large chunks of money for such training, usually.
