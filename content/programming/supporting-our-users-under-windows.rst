Supporting our users under Windows

Many of our users use Windows. I don't, I use Linux, but I completely
respect people's choice to use the OS they want, as I expect other
people to respect my choice. As Prabhu also run Linux (and MacOS X),
this means I should sometimes roll up my sleeves and try out Mayavi
under Windows. As my laptop came with a Windows installation that I did
not entirely nuke, I have the option of booting under Windows. For me
this is a tedious process: I don't know anything about Windows, I loose
all my beloved programs and have to struggle with non-Posix concepts.

To ease my pain, and make it easier for me to run Windows, Dave Peterson
has been pushing me to run a virtual machine. VMware is able to boot an
existing partition, and I installed it tonight (trick: Ubuntu users, add
the "partner" repository). After fighting a bit with VMware and Windows,
I was finally able to start the existing windows install in a virtual
box. Then, I was stopped by a stupid activation dialog. To make a long
story short, it seems that MicroSoft doesn't want me to use Windows on a
real machine and on a virtual machine at the same time. The canonical
solution is to buy a new Windows license, but this I won't do. I dislike
Windows, and will not be forced to buy license. It is not (only) a
question of Money: I have already spent more than that for me free
software activities, but the idea of being coerced in spending more
money on Microsoft products just to support Microsoft products simply
doesn't fit.

| If somebody has a clever way of getting around this problem, and
| allowing me to legally use a virtual machine for Windows, I would be
| very grateful.
