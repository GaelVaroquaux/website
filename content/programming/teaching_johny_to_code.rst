Teach Johnny to code
======================

Why Johny can't read: historical problem of people that cannot read.
Solution: teach people to read.

Workflow, Visual programming, GUIs = crap (don't scale. Though different
problems for GUIs, than for visual programming / workflows)

They are easier to get started with for beginners.

Software carpentry / data carpentry = Awesome

Cost up keeping to date is crucial (eg old code lying around from the 90s
= problems. It would be worst with visual programming.
