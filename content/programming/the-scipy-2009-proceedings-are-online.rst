We are finally announcing the online edition of SciPy proceedings:

http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/SciPy2009/

This year, we tried to raise the bar in terms of article quality. This
involved having a more strict review process, and we must thank a lot
all the reviewers. I have the feeling it did improve the quality of the
final papers. Actually, I must say that there are some really nice
papers in the proceedings. I am not going to list them here, you can
have a glance at the contents, but they range from fairly technical
papers on tools development that are more in the software engineering
and computer science fields, to application papers demonstrating how the
tools can be used.

I must apologize for the time it took to publish the proceedings. All
this was actually a lot of work, and it has taken me a lot of energy. I
hope that you will it was worth it.
