I just wanted to echo a `very good blog post`_ about usability:

.. epigraph:: **Users are busy not stupid.**

    As you design something, ask "is this relevant to what people are
    trying to do?" rather than "is this confusing?" [...] It doesn't
    matter whether people *could* figure something out. It matters
    whether they're interested in figuring it out - is it part of what
    they're trying to do, or an annoying sidetrack?

Read the `original blog post <http://log.ometer.com/2008-03.html#5>`_ and
ask yourself, when designing something: **"is this relevant to what
people are trying to do?"**.
