Using Python, Scipy, ETS, ... to implement art

The `Aikon project`_ has just been slashdotted.

The project is about implementing a robotic artist, with a special
artistic touch:

The Co-principal investigator, Patrick Tresset, gave a talk at the
French Pycon this year and I was simply flabbergasted by the project. It
is amazing to mix together art and technology in such a way, you should
really have a look at the `videos of the robotic arm making sketches of
people.`_

But I was even more startled when I discovered that the project was
using `scipy`_ and all my beloved stack for scientific computing in
Python, including the `Enthought Tool Suite`_: `check it out`_. I really
want scientific computing software to be tools opening new ideas and new
research. This research goes beyond my dreams.
