:summary: The main files of my phd thesis, to give an example of the LaTeX code used

`Here <attachments/gaeltex.zip>`_ are the main files I use for writing
`my PhD thesis <http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00265714>`_ with
LaTeX. I am not publishing them on the net as a model of what to do, as
at the end I was too much in a hurry to do a good job, and I hacked
kludges all over the code (it does not compile without overflows
anymore).

What turned out to be very handy was the use of the `memoir package
<http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/memoir/>`_. It
allowed me just enough customization while staying compact. In order to
make it work with some other packages I use, I had to hack it a bit
(horrible kludges again).

You need an install of the garamond fonts to build this (for epigraphs).
I use my own version.

Don't e-mail me to debug the problems you get by copying the kludges in
here. This is ugly code, that I put out because people were asking for
it.
